# An Analytical Walk Aboard the Titanic

[Kaggle's Titanic Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) provides an intellectual sandbox for those looking to enter the Data Science and Machine Learning realm. The objective provided in the problem description asks the analyst to apply machine learning tools in an effort to predict who will survive the sinking of the Titanic and those who will not.

In an effort to strengthen my programming knowledge across multiple languages, I am going to separate this analysis into two main parts:

1. **[Exploratory Data Analysis with R](eda_with_R.pdf)**

    * This will "tell the story" of the sinking of the Titanic using descriptive analytics on the training data, as well as provide some Bayes' Theorem and logistic regression interpretations using the data.

2. **Machine Learning with Python**

    * I will test a variety of classification algorithms on the training data, performing a grid search over all and then using the best model on the testing data.
